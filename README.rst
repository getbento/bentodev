Setup
-----
Upon using BentoDev for the first time you will be propmted to use add your BentoBox account.

You may also be asked for a password to get a remote token for your session.


Cloning Themes
--------------
By using the command ``bentodev list`` or ``bentodev start`` you will see the list of available Accounts and their current associated theme.

If you do not see any Accounts/Themes you need to create an Account that is associated to your User through the BentoBox website.

To work on an Account's theme you must first clone the theme. To do so use:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ bentodev clone <theme_name>

You may be prompted to connect your GitHub account to BentoBox if you have not done so previously.

The theme will then be cloned to the ``~/bentodev/sites/<theme_name>`` folder, where you can then push edits with standard git commands.

Working on Themes
-----------------
Once a theme has been cloned you can then run a small local server that will handle making requests to BentoBox.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ bentodev start <account_name>

You should then see the server run, where you can connect at `localhost:5000 <http://localhost:5000>`_

Development
===========

To develop simply Git clone the associated URL.

Feature or test branches created must have be approved through pull request review before merging with master.

To make use of all debugging features, run the BentoBox Django application locally and then run the bentodev server with the flag ``--local``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ bentodev start <account_name> --local
